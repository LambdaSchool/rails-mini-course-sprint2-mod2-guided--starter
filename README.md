# Ruby on Rails - Intermediate Ruby on Rails - Business Logic - Guided Project

We are going to build an API application that allows users to transfer money from their account to another users account.

We will have users that can initiate transfers to other users which will be tied to withdrawals and deposit transactions. Our basic models will consist of User, Transfer and Transaction.
